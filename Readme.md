Readme:

this is the description of steps I took to set up first a repository at github and clone it to my computer.

I added a new repository at github and named it UFs_BCB546_tryout-repository.
I did not add any files yet.

I cloned the repository to my computer with git clone and the URL.

Now I am adding a Readme.mk.

Looks like i have to tell git explicitly that my Readme.md is something to track: git add Reafme.md

git status tells me that I have this fiel and an updated version of it,

I committed the file and now I am changing it again.
