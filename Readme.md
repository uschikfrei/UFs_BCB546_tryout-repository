Readme:

this is the description of steps I took to set up first a repository at github and clone it to my computer.

I added a new repository at github and named it UFs_BCB546_tryout-repository.
I did not add any files yet.

I cloned the rpository to my computer with git clone and the URL.

Now I am adding a Readme.txt.
